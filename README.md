# pyevo

`pyevo` is a simple framework for simulating natural selection and the subsequent emergent phenomena. Loosely inspired by the [evolution modelling series by Primer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKortajF2dPBWMIS6KF4RLtQiG6KQrTdB)

## Example usage
At its core, `pyevo` enables definition of beings called `Blobs` which then inheract in defined sandbox environments. By varying the attributes of the `Blobs` and the corresponding `Environment` pressures and conditions, one can create simple simulations of natural selection.

The `examples` directory contains several example notebooks that function as guides for the basics of running and evaluating simulations. As an example, here's a study of population growth in an environment with four different blob types, each varying only by their survival and reproductive odds

This is only the start of the analyses that `pyevo` enables however. Here's an example of a large scale statistical study on the effects of varying survival and reproductive attributes across different blob types

## Contributing
Contributions at all levels are welcome! `pyevo` is a project in its infancy that I am unlikely to make considerable progress on just by myself, so please feel free to reach out at any time. I'm happy to discuss with anyone the potential for contributions at all levels. Please see ```CONTRIBUTING.md``` for some
general guidelines and message [me](mailto:jiaming.justin.chen@gmail.com) with any questions!
